This is a simple websocket and STOMP based chat application where a user can send text message to other users.

Currently, I have hardcoded 4 users with usernames (user1, user2, user3, user4) and corresponding passwords (pass1, pass2, pass3, pass4). 

To see it in action, run the app. Login with a pair of userID and password. Connect to the server. Select an user from the dropdown to chat with. Then type your message and hit send. The message should appear in the selected users chat window.

Future work includes:
1. Make user registrations dynamic.
2. Add the feature to verify the userlist one user is allowed to text.
3. Implement group chat
